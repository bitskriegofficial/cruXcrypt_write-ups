# Saving the Environment

## Solution

- We had the [website](https://environment.cruxcrypt.crux-bphc.com/)
- On this site we find the endpoint [/.env](https://environment.cruxcrypt.crux-bphc.com/.env) using the hint from the challenge name

- This prompts a download for an [env](./env) file which had the flag

## Flag

```
cruXcrypt{7ru1y_4_z3r0d4y_0f_0ur_t1m3}
```
