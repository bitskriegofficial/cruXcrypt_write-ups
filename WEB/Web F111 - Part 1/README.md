# Web F111 - Part 1

## Solution

- The description said to look for some interesting pages so I started enumerating a few well known pages.

- We find the `/t0p_s3cr3t` endpoint inside `robots.txt`.

- We get the flag just by visiting the endpoint.

> **Note**
> They forgot to add the robots.txt endpoint initially so we had to remind them xD

## Flag

```
cruXcrypt{7ru1y_4_z3r0d4y_0f_0ur_t1m3}
```
